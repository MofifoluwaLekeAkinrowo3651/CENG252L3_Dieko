# CENG252 - Lab03 "Sensors"
The lab introduces the use of a C++ class which combines data features of a C structure with functions on a the structure's data. 
I integrate the sensors into my Raspberry-Pi using two third-party programs:
1. RTIMU Sensor Library
2. sensehat.h/.cpp RTIMU interface software

Done on Code::Blocks
